          <strong>Turkey</strong>, country that occupies a unique geographic
          position, lying partly in Asia and partly in Europe. Throughout its
          history it has acted as both a barrier and a bridge between the two
          continents. Turkey is situated at the crossroads of the Balkans,
          Caucasus, Middle East, and eastern Mediterranean. It is among the
          larger countries of the region in terms of territory and population,
          and its land area is greater than that of any European state. Nearly
          all of the country is in Asia, comprising the oblong peninsula of Asia
          Minor—also known as Anatolia (Anadolu)—and, in the east, part of a
          mountainous region sometimes known as the Armenian Highland. The
          remainder—Turkish Thrace (Trakya)—lies in the extreme southeastern
          part of Europe, a tiny remnant of an empire that once extended over
          much of the Balkans. The country has a north-south extent that ranges
          from about 300 to 400 miles (480 to 640 km), and it stretches about
          1,000 miles from west to east.

        <span>The capital is Ankara, and its largest city and seaport is Istanbul.
          Of a total boundary length of some 4,000 miles (6,440 km), about
          three-fourths is maritime, including coastlines along the Black Sea,
          the Aegean, and the Mediterranean, as well as the narrows that link
          the Black and Aegean seas. These narrows—which include the Bosporus,
          the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles—are known collectively as the
          Turkish straits; Turkey’s control of the straits, the only outlet from
          the Black Sea, has been a major factor in its relations with other
          states. Most of the islands along the Aegean coast are Greek; only the
          islands of Gökçeada and Bozcaada remain in Turkish hands. The maritime
          boundary with Greece has been a source of dispute between the two
          countries on numerous occasions since World War II. A long succession
          of political entities existed in Asia Minor over the centuries.
          Turkmen tribes invaded Anatolia in the 11th century CE, founding the
          Seljuq empire; during the 14th century the Ottoman Empire began a long
          expansion, reaching its peak during the 17th century.

          The modern Turkish republic, founded in 1923 after the collapse of the
          Ottoman Empire, is a nationalist, secular, parliamentary democracy.
          <br /><br />
          After a period of one-party rule under its founder, Mustafa Kemal
          (Atatürk), and his successor, Turkish governments since the 1950s have
          been produced by multiparty elections based on universal adult
          suffrage. Turkey is a predominantly mountainous country, and true
          lowland is confined to the coastal fringes. About one-fourth of the
          surface has an elevation above 4,000 feet (1,200 metres), and less
          than two-fifths lies below 1,500 feet (460 metres). Mountain crests
          exceed 7,500 feet (2,300 metres) in many places, particularly in the
          east, where Turkey’s highest mountain, Mount Ararat (Ağrı), reaches
          16,945 feet (5,165 metres) close to the borders with Armenia and Iran.
          In the southeast the Uludoruk Peak reaches 15,563 feet (4,744 metres);
          though further west, the Demirkazık Peak (12,320 feet [3,755 metres])
          and Mount Aydos (11,414 feet [3,479 metres]) are also significant
          peaks. Steep slopes are common throughout the country, and flat or
          gently sloping land makes up barely one-sixth of the total area. These
          relief features affect other aspects of the physical environment,
          producing climates often much harsher than might be expected for a
          country of Turkey’s latitude and reducing the availability and
          productivity of agricultural land.
