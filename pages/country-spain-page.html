          <strong>Spain</strong>, country located in extreme southwestern
          Europe. It occupies about 85 percent of the Iberian Peninsula, which
          it shares with its smaller neighbour Portugal. Spain is a storied
          country of stone castles, snowcapped mountains, vast monuments, and
          sophisticated cities, all of which have made it a favoured travel
          destination. The country is geographically and culturally diverse. Its
          heartland is the Meseta, a broad central plateau half a mile above sea
          level. Much of the region is traditionally given over to cattle
          ranching and grain production; it was in this rural setting that
          Miguel de Cervantes’s Don Quixote tilted at the tall windmills that
          still dot the landscape in several places. In the country’s northeast
          are the broad valley of the Ebro River, the mountainous region of
          Catalonia, and the hilly coastal plain of Valencia. To the northwest
          is the Cantabrian Mountains, a rugged range in which heavily forested,
          rain-swept valleys are interspersed with tall peaks.

        <span>Spain’s countryside is quaint, speckled with castles, aqueducts, and
          ancient ruins, but its cities are resoundingly modern. The Andalusian
          capital of Sevilla (Seville) is famed for its musical culture and
          traditional folkways; the Catalonian capital of Barcelona for its
          secular architecture and maritime industry; and the national capital
          of Madrid for its winding streets, its museums and bookstores, and its
          around-the-clock lifestyle. Madrid is Spain’s largest city and is also
          its financial and cultural centre, as it has been for hundreds of
          years. The many and varied cultures that have gone into the making of
          Spain—those of the Castilians, Catalonians, Lusitanians, Galicians,
          Basques, Romans, Arabs, Jews, and Roma (Gypsies), among other
          peoples—are renowned for their varied cuisines, customs, and prolific
          contributions to the world’s artistic heritage. The country’s Roman
          conquerors left their language, roads, and monuments, while many of
          the Roman Empire’s greatest rulers were Spanish, among them Trajan,
          Hadrian, and Marcus Aurelius.

          Spain is bordered to the west by Portugal; to the northeast it borders
          France, from which it is separated by the tiny principality of Andorra
          and by the great wall of the Pyrenees Mountains.
          <br /><br />
          Spain’s only other land border is in the far south with Gibraltar, an
          enclave that belonged to Spain until 1713, when it was ceded to Great
          Britain in the Treaty of Utrecht at the end of the War of the Spanish
          Succession. Elsewhere the country is bounded by water: by the
          Mediterranean Sea to the east and southeast, by the Atlantic Ocean to
          the northwest and southwest, and by the Bay of Biscay (an inlet of the
          Atlantic Ocean) to the north. The Canary (Canarias) Islands, in the
          Atlantic Ocean off the northwestern African mainland, and the Balearic
          (Baleares) Islands, in the Mediterranean, also are parts of Spain, as
          are Ceuta and Melilla, two small enclaves in North Africa (northern
          Morocco) that Spain has ruled for centuries. Spain accounts for
          five-sixths of the Iberian Peninsula, the roughly quadrilateral
          southwestern tip of Europe that separates the Mediterranean Sea from
          the Atlantic Ocean. Most of Spain comprises a large plateau (the
          Meseta Central) divided by a mountain range, the Central Sierra
          (Sistema Central), which trends west-southwest to east-northeast.
          Several mountains border the plateau: the Cantabrian Mountains
          (Cordillera Cantábrica) to the north, the Iberian Cordillera (Sistema
          Ibérico) to the northeast and east, the Sierra Morena to the south,
          and the lower mountains of the Portuguese frontier and Spanish Galicia
          to the northwest.
