          <strong>Thailand</strong>, country located in the centre of mainland
          Southeast Asia. Located wholly within the tropics, Thailand
          encompasses diverse ecosystems, including the hilly forested areas of
          the northern frontier, the fertile rice fields of the central plains,
          the broad plateau of the northeast, and the rugged coasts along the
          narrow southern peninsula. Until the second half of the 20th century,
          Thailand was primarily an agricultural country, but since the 1960s
          increasing numbers of people have moved to Bangkok, the capital, and
          to other cities. Although the greater Bangkok metropolitan area
          remains the preeminent urban centre in the country, there are other
          sizable cities, such as Chiang Mai in the north, Nakhon Ratchasima
          (Khorat), Khon Kaen, and Udon Thani in the northeast, Pattaya in the
          southeast, and Hat Yai in the far south. Siam, as Thailand was
          officially called until 1939, was never brought under European
          colonial domination. Independent Siam was ruled by an absolute
          monarchy until a revolution there in 1932.

          >Thailand has been a constitutional monarchy, and all subsequent
          constitutions have provided for an elected parliament. Political
          authority, however, has often been held by the military, which has
          taken power through coups. During the last two decades of the 20th
          century and the first decade of the 21st, parliamentary democracy
          steadily gained wider popular support. Although a crisis emerged in
          2006, when the military, aligned with the monarchy, overthrew an
          elected government, new parliamentary elections were held—as promised
          by the interim government—in 2007. Thailand, which has about the same
          land area as Spain or France, consists of two broad geographic areas:
          a larger main section in the north and a smaller peninsular extension
          in the south. The main body of the country is surrounded by Myanmar
          (Burma) to the west, Laos to the north and east, Cambodia to the
          southeast, and the Gulf of Thailand to the south. Peninsular Thailand
          stretches southward from the southwestern corner of the country along
          the eastern edge of the Malay Peninsula.

          Thailand’s landscapes vary from low mountains to fertile alluvial
          plains dotted with rice paddies to sandy beaches set amid the
          equatorial latitudes of the Asian monsoons.
          <br /><br />
          The country is divided into five distinct physiographic regions: the
          folded mountains in the north and west, the Khorat Plateau in the
          northeast, the Chao Phraya River basin in the centre, the maritime
          corner of the central region in the southeast, and the long, slender
          peninsular portion in the southwest. The northern mountains, the
          southeastern continuation of the uplift process that formed the
          Himalayas, extend southward along the Thai-Myanmar border and reach as
          far south as northern Malaysia. Long granitic ridges were formed when
          great masses of molten rock forced their way upward through the older
          sedimentary strata. Peaks average about 5,200 feet (l,600 metres)
          above sea level. Mount Inthanon, at 8,481 feet (2,585 metres) the
          highest in the country, is in northwestern Thailand, near the
          historical city of Chiang Mai. The city is overshadowed by Mount
          Suthep, site of a famous Buddhist shrine and the royal summer palace.
          Some of the rugged limestone hills contain caves from which remains of
          prehistoric humans have been excavated. The northeast is coterminous
          with the Khorat Plateau, a vast tableland bounded by the Mekong River
          on the north and east. It was formed by uplifting along two
          perpendicularly arranged crustal faults—one trending north- south in
          the west and the other east-west in the south.
