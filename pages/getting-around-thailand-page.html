        <p>
            For a land mass as big as Turkey — stretching from the tip of Greece to Syria, from Bulgaria to Iran, and Iraq to Georgia and Armenia — the Turkish populace never seems to be without a means of transportation.
            Indeed, one of the best things about Turkey for a traveler is its list of transport options, from buses and bikes to trains, rental cars and more luxurious seaplanes. Here’s what you need to know about getting around Turkey.

            <h3>TUK TUK</h3>
            <p>
                The most indigenous mode of transport in Thailand, Tuk Tuks are the famous 3-wheeled vehicles that you would have seen in many travel-related photos of Southeast Asia.
                You should definitely take at least one ride on a Tuk Tuk as it is quite a memorable experience that you won’t find back home.

            <h3>SONGTHAEW</h3>
            <p>
                The name “songthaew” literally translates to “two rows” in English.
                Basically, Songthaews are small pick-up trucks which are comprised of 2 rows of seats at the back end of the vehicle for passengers to rest their legs on.
                It costs as little as 10 Baht to get to one side of a town to the other.

            <h3>BUSES</h3>
            <p>
                Your cheapest bus option will cost you a mere 7 Baht within Bangkok with other buses not costing too much more than that.
                There are long-distance buses departing from Bangkok to all over the country such as Pattaya, Hua Hin, Krabi, Phuket, Chiang Mai and so on.
