        <h1 id="title_bg"> GETTING AROUND CHINA</h1>
        <p>
            Despite its vast distances and huge variety of landscapes, getting around in China is convenient and
            inexpensive. Sparkling bullet trains zip to all corners of the country, while buses connect smaller
            towns
            and villages. Air travel is also convenient and generally affordable from most major cities.</p>

            <h3>TRAIN</h3>
            <p>
                Train travel is far and away the best way to get around China, for comfort, convenience and
                sustainability.China has the world’s longest and most-used high-speed railway network (nearly
                2300km/1429mi).In between, slower express, local and overnight trains connect many smaller towns.

            <h3>BUS</h3>
            <p>
                For more remote parts of China and small villages, long-distance buses are often the only option.Bus
                travel tends to be much cheaper than train or air tickets, and it's relatively comfortable, with
                vehicles ranging from express coaches to smaller minibuses and overnight sleeper buses.

            <h3>AIRPLANE</h3>
            <p>China’s airline industry has grown rapidly over the past decade, and there are now more than 240
                airports
                – one in almost every provincial capital and major city.The relative newness of China’s air
                industry
                means that most airports are correspondingly sleek, modern and easy to navigate. </p>

            <p>Many cities in China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xi’an, Chengdu, Chongqing, Suzhou, and
                Hangzhou, have cheap and efficient metro systems. The subway is the cheapest way to get around and
                it’s very intuitive.
