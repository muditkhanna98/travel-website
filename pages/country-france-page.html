          <strong>France</strong>, officially <strong>French Republic</strong>,
          Country, northwestern Europe. It includes the island of Corsica. Area:
          210,017 sq mi (543,941 sq km). Population: (2021 est.)
          65,404,000.Capital: Paris. The people are mainly French. Language:
          French (official). Religions: Christianity (predominantly Roman
          Catholic; also Protestant); also Islam, Judaism. Currency: euro.
          France has extensive plains, rivers, and a number of mountain ranges,
          including the Pyrenees and the Alps. The climate is generally
          moderate. More than half of the land is suitable for agriculture, and
          forests, largely unexploited, cover about one-fourth of the area.
          France has a developed mixed economy with a preponderance of small
          firms. It is a republic with two legislative houses; its head of state
          is the president, and the head of government is the prime minister.

        <span>France is among the globe’s oldest nations, the product of an
          alliance of duchies and principalities under a single ruler in the
          Middle Ages.Today, as in that era, central authority is vested in the
          state, even though a measure of autonomy has been granted to the
          country’s régions in recent decades. The French people look to the
          state as the primary guardian of liberty, and the state in turn
          provides a generous program of amenities for its citizens, from free
          education to health care and pension plans. Even so, this centralist
          tendency is often at odds with another long-standing theme of the
          French nation: the insistence on the supremacy of the individual. On
          this matter historian Jules Michelet remarked, “England is an empire,
          Germany is a nation, a race, France is a person.” Statesman Charles de
          Gaulle, too, famously complained, “Only peril can bring the French
          together. One can’t impose unity out of the blue on a country that has
          265 kinds of cheese.”

          At once universal and particular, French culture has spread far and
          greatly influenced the development of art and science, particularly
          anthropology, philosophy, and sociology.
          <br /><br />
          France has also been influential in government and civil affairs,
          giving the world important democratic ideals in the age of the
          Enlightenment and the French Revolution and inspiring the growth of
          reformist and even revolutionary movements for generations. The
          present Fifth Republic has, however, enjoyed notable stability since
          its promulgation on September 28, 1958, marked by a tremendous growth
          in private initiative and the rise of centrist politics. Although
          France has engaged in long-running disputes with other European powers
          (and, from time to time, with the United States, its longtime ally),
          it emerged as a leading member in the European Union (EU) and its
          predecessors. From 1966 to 1995 France did not participate in the
          integrated military structure of the North Atlantic Treaty
          Organization (NATO), retaining full control over its own air, ground,
          and naval forces; beginning in 1995, however, France was represented
          on the NATO Military Committee, and in 2009 French President Nicolas
          Sarkozy announced that the country would rejoin the organization’s
          military command. As one of the five permanent members of the United
          Nations Security Council—together with the United States, Russia, the
          United Kingdom, and China—France has the right to veto decisions put
          to the council.
