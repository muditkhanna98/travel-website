            destinations and ports of call, it’s no wonder cruise vacations continue to grow in popularity.

        <h3>Pack the right travel document</h3>

            <img src="../images/tips/travel-documents1.jpg" alt="Travel Documents">
        </div>
        <p>You’ll need a passport that’s valid for at least six months beyond your expected date of departure. Depending
            on where you’re travelling to, as well as your ship’s ports of call, you may also need travel Visas.</p>

        <p>If you’re traveling with a minor, and you’re not the parents or guardians, you’ll need a completed and signed
            Parent/Guardian release form before embarking on your cruise.</p>

        <p>Of course, be sure to also print and bring with you any other necessary documentation, including any forms
            issued by your travel provider.</p>

    <div id="checkin" class="tabcontent">
        <h3>Online check-in with cruise lines</h3>
        <div class="tab-img">
            <img src="../images/tips/online-check-in-1.jpg" alt="Online check in">
        </div>
        <p>Ports and airports can be busy, and while you can check-in in-person, the best way to avoid delays is to
            complete your registration online, if your cruise provider offers this service.</p>

        <p>We recommend registering on your trip line's website 45 to 5 days prior to departure day, using your
            reservation number. This also helps ensure you have maximum choice and flexibility when it comes to booking
            excursions, extracurricular activities, specialty restaurants and shows, all of which tend to fill up
            quickly.</p>

    <div id="insurance" class="tabcontent">
        <h3>Insurance</h3>
        <div class="tab-img">
            <img src="../images/tips/travel-insurance1.jpg" alt="Insurance">
        </div>
        <p>No one expects to be injured, become ill, or have their baggage lost or stolen. That’s why it’s so important
            to purchase the right kind of travel insurance before your trip.</p>

        <p>We offer a variety of coverage options underwritten by Travel Insurance, designed to provide added
            benefits and reassurance including protection against:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cost of unexpected medical expenses</li>
            <li>Loss of personal items</li>
            <li>Trip interruption or cancellation and more</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="internet" class="tabcontent">
        <h3>Internet and phone calls</h3>
        <div class="tab-img">
            <img src="../images/tips/internet.jpg" alt="Internet and phone calls">
        </div>
        <p>There is typically a fee to connect to the airport Wi-Fi, or use onboard internet services. Some charge by the
            minute, others may offer package rates. If you do need to purchase an internet package while you trip, we
            recommend doing so on the first day of your journey. That’s when the operator will typically offer the best value
            for their packages. Remember, internet service onboard can be unreliable, especially the further you are
            from land. Once you arrive, you can usually find a Wi-Fi network to connect to.</p>

        <p>Cell phone service may also be limited, and your service provider may charge additional roaming fees. Many
            cruise ships offer in-cabin phones, but may charge up to $8 per minute.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="paying" class="tabcontent">
        <h3>Paying onboard</h3>
        <div class="tab-img">
            <img src="../images/tips/paying-onboard.webp" alt="paying onboard">
        </div>
        <p>For added convenience and security, cruise lines will usually issue you a room key-card that also serves as
            your ID, and contains your credit card information. So all purchases made onboard get automatically charged
            to your credit card and, unless otherwise specified, are expressed in $USD or CAD.</p>
