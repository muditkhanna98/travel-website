            <p>
              Mont Saint-Michel is a highlight of the Normandy region, a
              pastoral landscape of apple orchards, woodlands, and cow pastures.
              This unmissable tourist attraction ranks number one on the long
              list of Normandy travel destinations, which includes stellar
              sights such as historic castles and picture-perfect towns. Built
              between the 11th and 13th centuries, the Abbey of Mont
              Saint-Michel is one of the most awe-inspiring sights in France.
              The UNESCO-listed abbey is perched on the hilltop of an islet in
              the Bay of Mont Saint-Michel and is considered a marvel of Gothic
              architecture. The abbey church was an important medieval
              pilgrimage site on the "Way of Saint James" route to Santiago de
              Compostela in Spain. Modern-day pilgrims still make the journey
              here, crossing the Bay of Saint-Michel by foot at low tide.

            <p>
              Like the scene of a fairy tale, magnificent castles are scattered
              throughout the densely forested landscape of the Loire Valley.
              Stretching for 280 kilometers, from Sully-sur-Loire to
              Chalonnes-sur-Loire in Anjou, the Loire Valley is the largest
              UNESCO-listed site in France. The region boasts an incredibly rich
              cultural heritage. During the 15th and 16th centuries, France's
              kings built sumptuous country retreats here purely for
              entertainment and enjoyment. Extravagant châteaux, such as the
              grandiose Château de Chambord and the emblematic Château de
              Chenonceau, offer insight into the opulence of the Renaissance-era
              French court. French nobles and elites also built stately manor
              houses, such as the majestic Château of Cheverny and the Château
              d'Azay-le-Rideau in an idyllic setting with a water-filled moat.
              For families with kids, the Mini-Châteaux Park in Amboise is a
              marvelous destination. Set in two hectares of woodlands, the
              amusement park features more than 40 replicas of Loire châteaux
              built on a 1/25 scale. Children love exploring the kid-sized
              castles designed with authentic details.

              Reims is justifiably placed among France's list of "Villes d'Art
              et d'Histoire" ("Cities of Art and History"). Of the town's three
              UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the most renowned is the Cathédrale
              Notre-Dame de Reims, where French kings were crowned. The most
              celebrated event was when Joan of Arc escorted Charles VII to the
              cathedral in July of 1429 for his coronation as king. Built in the
              13th century, the Notre-Dame Cathedral of Reims is a gem of High
              Gothic architecture. The dazzling exterior features a profusion of
              flying buttresses and sculpted angels, while the spacious interior
              has a solemn ambience of spirituality. Among the city's top
              attractions, other UNESCO-listed landmarks include the Palais du
              Tau, a 17th-century Archbishops' Palace, and the 11th-century
              Basilique Saint-Rémi.

              A picturesque coastal region, Brittany has a rich maritime
              heritage seen in its historic port towns: Saint-Malo, surrounded
              by old ramparts; the medieval capital of Nantes; and the fortified
              14th-century Concarneau. The seaside also boasts stylish beach
              resorts like fashionable Dinard on the Côte d'Emeraude, the
              summertime vacation destination of La Baule on the estuary of the
              Loire River, and Tréboul near the lovely riverside town of
              Quimper. The scenery is dramatic and unspoiled, with secluded
              sandy beaches and a rocky coastline, where wild Atlantic waves
              crash against the shore. Centuries-old fishing villages are
              sheltered in quiet bays and on tiny windswept offshore islands.
              Breton culture can be traced back to the Celts (the local dialect
              is related to Gaelic). Similar to Ireland, it is a land of
              mythology and legends. Today, Brittany is strongly Catholic.
              Locals celebrate ancient religious customs called "pardons,"
              special festivals when townspeople wear old-fashioned regional
              costumes. The local cuisine features delicious specialties such as
              fresh seafood and savory buckwheat crepes. Brittany also has a
              famous regional pastry, the "kouign-amann," a buttery pastry made
              with croissant dough that is layered with sprinkles of sugar, has
              a moist cake-like center, and a crispy caramelized exterior.

              A blend of Parisian-style elegance and the untamed natural beauty
              of the Atlantic coast, Biarritz is an upscale seaside resort with
              fabulous beaches. Biarritz was favored by Empress Eugénie, who
              loved this area of the Basque region. She chose a sandy hillside
              overlooking the Bay of Biscay as the location for her Imperial
              residence, the Villa Eugénie. This Second Empire palace has been
              converted into luxury accommodations, the five-star Hôtel du
              Palais, which offers exquisitely decorated guest rooms and an
              oceanfront gastronomic restaurant. Next to the hotel property is
              the Grande Plage, a sandy beach that has attracted sunbathers
              since the Belle Epoque. Another of the top beaches in Biarritz is
              the Plage du Miramar. A picturesque scene of colorful, striped
              cabanas and parasols during summertime, this sheltered beach has
              the delightful ambience of an old-fashioned seaside resort.

              France's national heroine, Joan of Arc led the country to victory
              during the Hundred Years' War when she was only seventeen years
              old. Her divinely ordained mission, instructed by heavenly voices,
              is still an inspiration to the faithful. Joan of Arc's remarkable
              story began in Chinon, where on March 9, 1429, she went to meet
              the future Charles VII (the "Dauphin") at the Forteresse Royale (a
              medieval fortified castle). On this momentous occasion, the "Maid
              of Orléans" informed the Dauphin of his right to the crown and
              asked for help in forming an army, which was needed to break the
              Siege of Orléans (a pivotal event during the Hundred Years' War
              between France and England). Because of its rich heritage, Chinon
              is listed as a Ville d'Art et d'Histoire (City of Art and
              History). At the tree-lined Place Jeanne d'Arc stands a monumental
              bronze equestrian statue of Joan of Arc depicted as a heroic
              military leader. Among the top attractions of the Loire Valley,
              Orléans is another essential stop on the Joan of Arc trail. The
              city was saved by the "Maid of Orléans," during the Siege of 1429.
              After leading the French to defeat the English army, Joan of Arc
              came to the town's Cathédrale Sainte-Croix to pray. The
              cathedral's 19th-century stained-glass windows recount the history
              of Joan of Arc.

              The historic cities of Strasbourg and Colmar, along with the
              hundreds of Alsatian villages, have a special old-world charm that
              is completely distinct from the rest of France. The architecture
              and ambience of Alsace has been influenced over the centuries by
              neighboring Germany, as seen in the brightly painted,
              half-timbered buildings and venerable Gothic churches. Quaint and
              cultured, Strasbourg enchants visitors with its narrow cobblestone
              streets, scenic canals, and ornate cathedral. Colmar is the
              quintessential Alsatian town, full of interesting old churches and
              traditional houses with flower-bedecked balconies. Outside these
              two cities is an unspoiled landscape of vine-covered foothills.
              Nestled in the valleys and along the Rhine River are tiny
              storybook hamlets and picturesque villages.

              The French Alps boast some of the most awe-inspiring natural
              scenery in the world. The majestic Mont Blanc is the highest
              mountain in Europe, an iconic snowcapped peak that soars to 4,810
              meters. At this altitude, the air is fresh and the landscape is
              sublime, with crystal-clear lakes, dramatic rushing waterfalls,
              peaceful valleys, and refreshing pine forests. During summertime,
              visitors flock to the Alps to go hiking, cycling, and mountain
              climbing. In the winter, the French Alps draws many tourists for
              Alpine skiing, snowboarding, and cross-country skiing. The area
              has many of France's top-rated ski resorts. Other things to do
              during the snowy season include ice-skating, dog sledding rides,
              and old-fashioned horse-drawn sleigh rides. Besides the
              spectacular mountain terrain, the region also has a rich cultural
              heritage linked to the ancestral territory of the Italian royal
              House of Savoy, as well as the historic Dauphiné region.

              The Dordogne region is one of the best places to visit in France
              for viewing prehistoric cave paintings. Designated as a UNESCO
              World Heritage Site, the Lascaux Cave in the Dordogne's Vallée de
              la Vézère contains masterpieces of Paleolithic art created by
              Cro-Magnon man. Although the Lascaux Cave has been closed to the
              public to prevent damage, visitors may view copies of the cave's
              artwork at the nearby Lascaux II site (in Montignac). Also in
              Montignac is the Centre International de l'Art Pariétal
              (International Center of Cave Art), which presents exhibits about
              prehistoric animal paintings and reveals the work of
              archaeologists. The center includes Lascaux IV, which is a
              complete replica of the prehistoric Lascaux Cave. Also in the
              Vézère Valley, the Grotte de Rouffignac is adorned with paintings
              of horses, cows, bison, deer, goats, and mammoths.

              The Bordeaux region is a beautiful bucolic corner of France, where
              grandiose castles preside over rolling, vine-covered hills. Scenic
              tree-shaded paths traverse the countryside and follow alongside
              the Garonne River, as well as its placid canals. Many travelers
              enjoy exploring this area on a leisurely cycling itinerary. The
              region has two exceptional UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the
              elegant city of Bordeaux, with more than 350 buildings classified
              as historical monuments, and the little country village of
              Saint-Émilion, 51 kilometers from Bordeaux, which is packed with
              notable churches and monasteries.
