          <strong>Japan</strong>, Island country, East Asia, western Pacific
          Ocean. Its four main islands are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and
          Kyushu. It is separated from the Asian mainland by the Sea of Japan
          (East Sea). Area: 145,937 sq mi (377,975 sq km). Population: (2021
          est.) 125,497,000. Capital: Tokyo. The Japanese overwhelmingly are a
          single Asian ethnic group. Language: Japanese (official). Religions:
          Shintō, Buddhism; also Christianity. Currency: yen. Situated in one of
          Earth’s most geologically active zones, Japan experiences volcanic
          eruptions and earthquakes. Mountain ranges cover some four-fifths of
          its land surface; its highest mountain is Mount Fuji. The economy, one
          of the world’s biggest, is based largely on manufacturing and
          services; exports include electronic and electrical equipment, motor
          vehicles, chemicals, and iron and steel products. The government’s
          involvement in banking results in unique cooperation between the
          public and private sectors.

        <span>The Japanese landscape is rugged, with more than four-fifths of the
          land surface consisting of mountains. There are many active and
          dormant volcanoes, including Mount Fuji (Fuji-san), which, at an
          elevation of 12,388 feet (3,776 metres), is Japan’s highest mountain.
          Abundant precipitation and the generally mild temperatures throughout
          most of the country have produced a lush vegetation cover and, despite
          the mountainous terrain and generally poor soils, have made it
          possible to raise a variety of crops. Japan has a large and, to a
          great extent, ethnically homogeneous population, which is heavily
          concentrated in the low-lying areas along the Pacific coast of Honshu.
          Complexity and contrast are the keynotes of life in Japan—a country
          possessing an intricate and ancient cultural tradition yet one that,
          since 1950, has emerged as one of the world’s most economically and
          technologically advanced societies. Heavy emphasis is placed on
          education, and Japan is one of the world’s most literate countries.

          Japan is bounded to the west by the Sea of Japan (East Sea), which
          separates it from the eastern shores of South and North Korea and
          southeastern Siberia (Russia);
          <br /><br />
          The mountainous character of the country is the outcome of orogenic
          (mountain-building) forces largely during Quaternary time (roughly,
          the past 2.6 million years), as evidenced by the frequent occurrence
          of violent earthquakes, volcanic activity, and signs of change in sea
          levels along the coast. There are no sizable structural plains and
          peneplains (large land areas leveled by erosion), features that
          usually occur in more stable regions of the Earth. The mountains are
          for the most part in a youthful stage of dissection in which steep
          slopes are incised by dense river-valley networks. Rivers are mostly
          torrential, and their valleys are accompanied by series of river
          terraces that are the result of movements in the Earth’s crust, as
          well as climatic and sea-level changes in Holocene times (i.e., the
          past 11,700 years). Recent volcanoes are juxtaposed with old and
          highly dissected ones. The shores are characterized by elevated and
          depressed features such as headlands and bays, which display an
          incipient stage of development. The mountains are divided into many
          small land blocks that are separated by lowlands or deep saddles;
          there is no long or continuous mountain range. These land blocks are
          the result of intense faulting (movement of adjacent rock masses along
          a fracture) and warping; the former process is regarded as dominant.
