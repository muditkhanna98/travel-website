          <strong>China</strong>, officially <strong>People’s Republic of China</strong>, 
          Country, eastern Asia. Area: 3,696,118 sq mi (9,572,900 sq km). Population: 
          (2021 est.) 1,416,687,000. Capital: Beijing. It is the world’s most populous
          country, the Han (ethnic Chinese) forming more than nine-tenths of the
          population. Languages: dialects of Han Chinese, Mandarin being the most important. 
          Religions: traditional beliefs, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Daoism 
          (all legally sanctioned). Currency: renminbi (of which the unit is the yuan). 
          The southwestern area contains the Plateau of Tibet, which averages more than 
          13,000 ft (4,000 m) above sea level; its core area, averaging more than 16,000
          ft (5,000 m) in elevation, is called “the Roof of the World” and provides the 
          headwaters for many of Asia’s major rivers. China’s northwestern region stretches 
          from Afghanistan to the Northeast (Manchurian) Plain. The Tien Shan (“Celestial 
          Mountains”) separate China’s two major interior basins, the Tarim Basin (containing 
          the Takla Makan Desert) and the Junggar Basin.

        <span>The most remarkable feature of China’s relief is the vast extent of
          its mountain chains; the mountains, indeed, have exerted a tremendous
          influence on the country’s political, economic, and cultural
          development. By rough estimate, about one-third of the total area of
          China consists of mountains. China has the world’s tallest mountain
          and the world’s highest and largest plateau, in addition to possessing
          extensive coastal plains. The five major landforms—mountain, plateau,
          hill, plain, and basin—are all well represented. China’s complex
          natural environment and rich natural resources are closely connected
          with the varied nature of its relief. The topography of China is
          marked by many splendours. Mount Everest (Qomolangma Feng), situated
          on the border between China and Nepal, is the highest peak in the
          world, at an elevation of 29,035 feet (8,850 metres; see Researcher’s
          Note: Height of Mount Everest). By contrast, the lowest part of the
          Turfan Depression in the Uygur Autonomous Region of Xinjiang—Lake
          Ayding—is 508 feet (155 metres) below sea level.

          The Sichuan Basin is one of the most attractive geographical regions
          of China. The Sichuan Basin is surrounded by mountains, which are
          higher in the west and north.
          <br /><br />
          Protected against the penetration of cold northern winds, the basin is
          much warmer in the winter than are the more southerly plains of
          southeast China. Except for the Chengdu Plain, the region is hilly.
          The relief of the basin’s eastern half consists of numerous folds,
          forming a series of ridges and valleys that trend northeast to
          southwest. The lack of arable land has obliged farmers to cultivate
          the slopes of the hills, on which they have built terraces that
          frequently cover the slopes from top to bottom. The terracing has
          slowed down the process of erosion and has made it possible to
          cultivate additional areas by using the steeper slopes—some of which
          have grades up to 45° or more. Southeastern China is bordered by a
          rocky shoreline backed by picturesque mountains. In general, there is
          a distinct structural and topographic trend from northeast to
          southwest. The higher peaks may reach elevations of some 5,000 to
          6,500 feet (1,500 to 2,000 metres). The rivers are short and
          fast-flowing and have cut steep-sided valleys. The chief areas of
          settlement are on narrow strips of coastal plain where rice is
          produced. Along the coast there are numerous islands, where the
          fishing industry is well developed. East of Yichang, in Hubei
          province, a series of plains of uneven width are found along the
          Yangtze River (Chang Jiang).
