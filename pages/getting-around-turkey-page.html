        <h1 id="title_bg"> GETTING AROUND TURKEY</h1>
        <p>
            For a land mass as big as Turkey — stretching from the tip of Greece to Syria, from Bulgaria to Iran, and Iraq to Georgia and Armenia — the Turkish populace never seems to be without a means of transportation.
            Indeed, one of the best things about Turkey for a traveler is its list of transport options, from buses and bikes to trains, rental cars and more luxurious seaplanes. Here’s what you need to know about getting around Turkey.
        </p>

            <h3>RENTING A CAR</h3>
            <p>
                Renting a car is relatively easy as long as you have a means of ID, such as your passport and driver’s license.
                Most travelers from Europe and North America can use their own country’s driver’s license rather than an international driving permit,
                but check with your rental car company ahead of time to be sure.

            <h3>DOLMUS</h3>
            <p>
                For short hauls across cities and coastal towns, you’ll face the sweatier version — riding a dolmus.
                “Dolmus” in English means “stuffed,” so stuffed to the gunwales it will be with tourists, locals and maybe an odd chicken or duck going to market.

            <h3>MOTORBIKES</h3>
            <p>
                Scooters and motorbikes are the favorites for young and adventurous travelers, and they are relatively inexpensive and easy to rent. A popular rental is the electric scooter.
                It’s affordable to use and is becoming one of the main forms of transport for Turks as fuel costs continue to reach new highs.

            <h3>SEAPLANE</h3>
            <p>
                A relative newcomer to the transport sector is the seaplane. Privately operated, the seaplane flies travelers from Istanbul to coastal areas.
                However, it is achieving 85 per cent capacity in flights and intends to expand its service from Istanbul to Ankara.
